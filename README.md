# Pixel-Manipulation

This is a simple Python script that performs image encryption and decryption using a bitwise XOR operation. It works by applying a numeric key (0‚Äì255) to each pixel's RGB values. The same key is used to decrypt the image back to its original state.

üîç How the Code Works

Your script performs image encryption and decryption using a bitwise XOR operation on each pixel's color values. Here's how:

......User Input (CLI)

2. The script first asks the user:

3. Whether they want to encrypt or decrypt (E or D)

4. The path of the input image file

5. The desired output image file name

6. A numeric key (between 0 and 255)

7. This key will be used for the XOR operation.

.....Accessing Pixels
